A producer of various feed additives for cattle conducts a study of the number of days of
feedlot time required to bring beef cattle to market weight. Eighteen steers of essentially identical
age and weight are purchased and brought to a feedlot. Each steer is fed a diet with a specific
combination of protein content, antibiotic concentration, and percentage of feed supplement.
