A producer of various feed additives for cattle conducts a study of the number of days of
feedlot time required to bring beef cattle to market weight. Eighteen steers of essentially identical
age and weight are purchased and brought to a feedlot. Each steer is fed a diet with a specific
combination of protein content, antibiotic concentration, and percentage of feed supplement.


| Regression |  Pearson Correlation Coefficients  |  Simple Linear Regression Equation  |  R^2  |   
|----------|----|----|----|    
|time - protein   |  -0.71  | y=89.83-0.833x   |  0.51  |    
|time - antibio   |  -0.42  |  y=83.33-4x  |  0.17   |   
|time - supplem   |  -0.47  | y=84.21-1.38x   |  0.22  |    

Estimated equation of the multiple regression of time on all variables
time = 102.71 - 0.83*protein - 4*antibio - 1.38*supplem
R^2 = 0.9

The proportion of variability in time explained by the linear regression of the x's is 0.9.
